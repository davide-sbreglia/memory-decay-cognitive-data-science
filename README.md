# Memory Decay in LLMs â€“ Cognitive Data Science Project

This repository contains the final report, code and analysis for a short research project carried out as part of the Cognitive Data Science course at the University of Trento.

Project summary

We simulated memory decay processes using a large language model (Mistral 7B) and evaluated how forgetting patterns emerge over time or under constraint.

Key components:
- Prompt design for memory erosion
- Response logging and time-based analysis
- Python scripts for plotting and parsing output
- Final report with discussion and reflections

Contents
- `report.pdf`: full report with methodology, results and references
- `src/`: Python scripts for analysis
- `data/`: sample data or generated outputs
